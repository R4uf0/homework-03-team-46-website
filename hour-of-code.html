                <h4>Hour of Code</h4>
                <p>The event called “The Hour of Code” was held at school No. 204 on the 5th of November 4 from 8:40 AM
                    till 9:40 AM with 22 participants. During the event participants were given to solve the classic
                    maze puzzle which consisted of 20 problems. Most of the participants were familiar with programming,
                    however some of them happened to progress quickly throughout the puzzles. Participants that were
                    struggling with some of the puzzles were assisted by our group. After completing the puzzles each
                    participant received a certificate for completing the hour of code.</p>
